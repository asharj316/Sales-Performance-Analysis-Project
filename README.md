# Sales-Performance-Analysis-Project

    Cleaned and preprocessed raw sales data (handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting columns).

    Combined 12 months of sales data into a single CSV for streamlined analysis.

    Visualized monthly sales trends and city-wise sales performance to identify peak revenue periods and top-performing regions.

🔍 Key Insights:

    December had the highest sales, followed by April and October.

    San Francisco was the top-performing city in terms of revenue.
